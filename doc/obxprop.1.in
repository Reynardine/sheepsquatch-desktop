.SH "DESCRIPTION" 
.PP 
obxprop is a tool for displaying the properties on an x 
window. 
.PP 
This tool has a similar functionality to \fBxprop\fR, 
but obxprop allows you to see UTF-8 strings as text. 
.PP 
You may use the \fB\-\-id\fR option to specify a window 
identifier, otherwise obxprop will allow you to select a window by 
clicking on it. 
.PP 
Primarily, this tool exists for Openbox users to see the value of the 
_OB_APP_NAME, _OB_APP_CLASS, _OB_APP_ROLE, and _OB_APP_TYPE properties, 
which Openbox uses for 
matching windows against user-defined application rules. 
.SH "OPTIONS" 
.PP 
These are the possible options that \fBsheep\fR accepts: 
.IP "\fB\-\-help\fP" 10 
Show a summary of the options available. 
.IP "\fB\-\-display\fP DISPLAY" 10 
Specify the X display to use. 
.IP "\fB\-\-id\fP ID" 10 
Specify the window identifier for the window whose properties 
will be displayed.

you may pass one or more property names to have 
\fBsheep\fR limit its output to only the properties 
requested.
